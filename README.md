This is the back-end portion of a fitness tracker Web application.

The back-end is written in NodeJS and utilizes AWS Lambda for cloud hosting and DynamoDB for its database.

We all know that it's unhealthy to sit for long stretches of time. However, remembering to include short breaks is for some reason not so easy.

This application was designed for anyone who uses a computer for long stretches of time and needs a reminder to get up at regular intervals.

Users can create a list of fitness activities to do and set a timer to go off at regular intervals. Each time the timer goes off, an activity that the user has created will be displayed. Both the work and rest intervals can be adjusted by the user as well. 

As far as activities go, the sky's the limit: exercises, stretches, getting a glass of water, or a fruit, or simply changing to a standing position.
